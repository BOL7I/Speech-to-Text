# Speech-to-Text
Designed and implemented a real-time desktop application that combines saved video with audio capture and speech-to-text conversion. Leveraged OpenCV to stream webcam footage while concurrently capturing system audio using sounddevice and saving it as WAV files with scipy.io.wavfile. Integrated Google Speech Recognition API via the speech_recognition library to transcribe spoken audio to text. The application was built using multithreading and a thread-safe queue system to efficiently manage parallel audio processing and transcription without interrupting the video stream. This project highlights skills in concurrent programming, audio signal handling, and external API integration. It also demonstrates effective use of exception handling to manage runtime errors in both video and audio modules. This system can be applied in scenarios such as live transcription, meeting summarization, accessibility tools for the hearing impaired, or voice-driven video annotation platforms.
